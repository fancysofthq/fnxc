== Foreword

The https://nxsf.org/onyx[Onyx programming language Standard] specifies the language itself, but not implementation details of a compiler (with an exception being the Onyx CLI Standard specification).

Vendors are shipping their own Onyx compiler implementations, with subtle or significant differences: the variety of supported targets, implied optimizations, and even compilation modes.

The following document describes implementation details of the Fancy Onyx Compiler, an Onyx compiler implementation by https://fancysoft.xyz[Fancy Software], shortcut as FNXC.
