= NXIR

TODO: NXIR is to be standardized.

_NXIR_ stays for the _Onyx Intermediate Representation_.

A source file containing an implementation of a procedure or type specialization, or a definition of a static value, or a declaration of an external function, becomes an NXIR module.

An NXIR module, akin to an LLIR module, contains type, function and variable definitions, as well as function and variable declarations.

Annotations are also preserved in NXIR.
LLIR generator makes use of some built-in annotations, e.g. `@[NeverInline]`.
A linker, for example, may also make use of some `@[Entry]`-annotated function or a `@[Section]`-annotated variable.

NXIR does not contain neither generators nor macros.

NXIR does not contain information of whether an `Undef` function argument is poly- or mono-morphic.
They are said to have undefined morphism.

An NXIR module is then translated to a xref:llir[LLIR] module.
