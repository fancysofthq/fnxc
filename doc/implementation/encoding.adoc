= Encoding

At the moment, an input file shall contain US-ASCII characters only, excluding char and string literals and explicit identifiers.
A non-US-ASCII character met outside of these boundaries is considered a syntactic error.

A source file shall be encoded either in US-ASCII or UTF-8 without BOM.

Char literals are in UCS charset only, and string literals are in UTF-8 encoding only.

== Future work

In the future:

* Identifiers may be in Unicode (see https://unicode.org/reports/tr31/).

* Operators may support Unicode characters with `Sm` category (Math Symbol).

* Char literals may support charset other than UCS.

* String literals may support encoding other than UTF-8.

* Linebreak characters are lexed in accordance to https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/.

* `Zs`-category Unicode characters are accepted as white space characters.
