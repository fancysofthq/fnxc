== Host platforms

FNXC is written in fairly-portable standard C++20 with a major dependency on LLVM 10.

The developers claim supporting recent versions of `Windows`, `Linux` and `MacOS` operating systems on `amd64`, `arm7` and `arm8` architectures as host platforms.

== Target platforms

An Onyx program may be compiled for one of `amd64`, `arm7`, `arm8`, `nvptx` or `amdgpu` architectures with FNXC.

The implementation is aware of a subset of processors defined by the Standard, as per xref:table-list-of-known-processors[].
